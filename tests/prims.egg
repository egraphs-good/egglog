; ==== "INIT" RULESET ====

      :ruleset init)

; Whether a vertex is included *so far* (this changes). Returns 0 or 1.

; All vertices default to being not included (note vertex-included's :merge)

; Keep track of the current iteration
(function current-iteration () i64 :merge (max old new))

; Map iteration to best edge found so far
(function iteration-to-best-edge (i64) edge :merge new)
(function iteration-to-best-edge-weight (i64) i64 :merge new)

       (set (current-iteration) 0)
       (set (iteration-to-best-edge-weight 0) infinity))
      :ruleset init)

; === "CHOOSE BEST EDGE" RULESET ===

(relation edge-in-mst (edge))  ; whether an edge is in our solution

(ruleset choose-best-edge)
(rule ((= i (current-iteration))
       (edge-exists (Edge x y weight))
       (= 1 (vertex-included x))
       (= 0 (vertex-included y))

; === "FINISH ITERATION" RULESET ===

(ruleset finish-iteration)
(rule ((= i (current-iteration))
       (= (Edge x y weight) (iteration-to-best-edge i)))
      ((edge-in-mst (Edge x y weight))    ; incorporate chosen best edge
       (set (vertex-included x) 1)        ; mark its vertices as included
       (set (vertex-included y) 1)
       (set (current-iteration) (+ i 1))  ; advance iteration
       (set (iteration-to-best-edge-weight (+ i 1)) infinity))
      :ruleset finish-iteration)

; === RUN VIA SCHEDULE ===

(run-schedule
    (saturate init graph1)  ; change to graph2 to see other example
    (saturate (saturate choose-best-edge) finish-iteration)
)

; === PRINT RESULTS ===

; (print-function edge-in-mst) ; this is not very helpful

; Just copy canonical edges to solution
(relation solution (i64 i64 i64))

(ruleset finalize)
(rule ((edge-in-mst (Edge x y weight)) (< x y))
      ((solution x y weight))
      :ruleset finalize)
(run-schedule (saturate finalize))

(print-function solution 100) ; this is better
