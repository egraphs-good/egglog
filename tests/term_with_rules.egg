; Test :nounion sorts with rules
; Rules can still pattern match on :nounion sorts and create new terms

(sort TermSort :nounion)
(constructor term-node (i64) TermSort)
(constructor term-pair (TermSort TermSort) TermSort)

; Create some term nodes
(term-node 1)
(term-node 2)
(term-node 3)

; Create some pairs
(term-pair (term-node 1) (term-node 2))
(term-pair (term-node 2) (term-node 3))

; Rule to propagate terms - this creates new term entries but doesn't union
(rule ((term-pair x y))
      ((term-pair y x)))  ; Create reverse pair

(run 1)

; Check that the original pairs exist
(check (term-pair (term-node 1) (term-node 2)))
(check (term-pair (term-node 2) (term-node 3)))

; Check that the reverse pairs were created
(check (term-pair (term-node 2) (term-node 1)))
(check (term-pair (term-node 3) (term-node 2)))
