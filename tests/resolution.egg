; Resolution theorem proving
; 
; Traditional resolution theorem provers maintain a clause database
; of formulas in Conjunction Normal Form (CNF a big And of Ors).
; Each clause is a set of positive and negative literals
; The prover saturates this set by taking two clauses 
; {a}\/c1  {not a}\/c2 and creating a new clause c1 \/ c2.
; Clauses also are pruned by simplications, unit propagation,
; and subsumption.
; These systems use sophisticated term indexing to find matching clauses

; A natural question is whether egglog's saturation and term indexing gives
; a leg up towards building one of these systems. A programmable one even,
; with built in support for equality reasoning

; Resolution is provided by a join
; unit propagation is an equation solving process and egraph substitution
; Clause Simplification is provided by rewrite rules

; This encoding seems about right but is unsatisfying
; Using AC to encode the set nature of clauses is inefficient

; An important aspect of these provers that seems challenging to encode shallowly
; is that the match also occurs modulo _unification_.
; The unification variables of each clause are not globally scoped, really
; they are scoped outside the body of each clase in an implicit \forall
; This encoding as it stands really only supports ground atoms modulo equality

; This counts on commutativity to bubble everything possible up to the front of the clause.
