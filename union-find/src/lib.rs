//! This crate contains two basic union-find implementations:
//!
//! * [`UnionFind`], a basic single-threaded union-find data-structure.
//! * [`concurrent::UnionFind`], a concurrent union-find data-structure.
//!
//! Both structures are fairly rudimentary and are customized to be used in an
//! egraph-related setting. In particular, they do "union by min id", which is a
//! strategy that _does not_ guarantee the same asymptotic complexity as the
//! main techniques in the literature (e.g. union by rank). Union by min is a
//! heuristic introduced to reduce the number of ids perturbed during congruence
//! closure. There's likely more to do in this area but for now it seems to work
//! well enough. It doesn't hurt that it's also simpler to implement.
