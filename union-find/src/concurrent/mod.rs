///
/// This implementation supports concurrent finds and merges, with path
/// compression. Importantly, this implementation supports dynamically resizing
/// the underlying array when new ids appear. This allows callers to generate
/// Ids more flexibly, though huge amounts of resizing will cause contention as
/// callers wait for resizes to complete.
///
/// The `Clone` implementation for this type is shallow: copies of the
/// data-structure see one another's updates.
