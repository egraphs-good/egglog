//! The core union-find implementation.
//!
//! This implementation is inspired by "Concurrent Disjoint Set Union" by
//! Siddhartha Jayanti and Robert Tarjan, but it includes changes and extensions
//! to make it work with egglog's requirements. On the whole, it's a bit simpler
//! than the implementation in the paper. A few notes:
//!
//! * We don't bother with union-by-rank: this isn't in use in egg or egglog. We
//!   currently implement "union by min" which is a simple heuristic that folks
//!   _hypothesize_ does well in practice for egraph applications. Depending on
//!   how well this pans out, we may want to use something closer to the
//!   randomized link by rank from the paper.
//!
//! * As in the paper, we use splitting for path compression, using the two-try
//!   variant from the paper.
