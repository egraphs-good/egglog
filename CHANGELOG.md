## [0.1.0] - 2023-10-24
This is egglog's first release! Egglog is ready for use, but is still fairly experimental. Expect some significant changes in the future.

- Egglog is better than [egg](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg) in many ways, including performance and new features.
- Egglog now includes cargo documentation for the language interface.

As of yet, the rust interface is not documented or well supported. We reccomend using the language interface. Egglog also lacks proofs, a feature that egg has.
